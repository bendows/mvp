                <h2>Full cross-browser support</h2>
        <p>The holy grail 3 column liquid Layout has been tested on the following browsers:</p>

        <h3>iPhone &amp; iPod Touch</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Safari</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Mac</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Safari</li>
          <li>Firefox</li>
          <li>Opera 9.25</li>
          <li>Netscape 9.0.0.5 &amp; 7.1</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Windows</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Firefox 1.5 &amp; 2</li>

          <li>Safari</li>
          <li>Opera 8.1 &amp; 9</li>
          <li>Explorer 5.5, 6 &amp; 7</li>
          <li>Netscape 8</li>
        </ul>
                <h2>Valid XHTML strict markup</h2>
        <p>The HTML in this layout validates as XHTML 1.0 strict.</p>
                <h2>Resizable text compatible</h2>
        <p>This layout is fully compatible with resizable text. Resizable text is important for web accessibility. People who are vision impaired can make the text larger so it's easier for them to read. It is becoming increasingly more important to make your website resizable text compatible because people are expecting higher levels of web accessibility. Apple have made resizing the text on a website simple with the pinch gesture on their multi-touch trackpad. So far this trackpad is only available on the MacBook Air but it will soon be rolled out to all of their systems. Is your website text-resizing compatible?</p>
        <h2>FREE for anyone to use</h2>
                <p>You don't have to pay anything. Simply view the source of this page and save the HTML onto your computer. My only suggestion is to <a href="http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/adding-css-to-html-with-link-embed-inline-and-import">put the CSS into a separate file</a>. If you are feeling generous however, link back to this page so other people can find and use this layout too.</p>
                <h2>Free traffic for your website</h2>
                <p>If you use this layout for your website <a href="http://matthewjamestaylor.com/about">send me an email</a> with the link and any other information you have so I can add you to my list of example sites. Once I have a few links I'll publish them on my website and you'll get free traffic!</p>
